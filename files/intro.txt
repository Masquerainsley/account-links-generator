# Logging in to the AWS Console

Go to https://webops-users.signin.aws.amazon.com/console and log in with your IAM credentials, ensure you have MFA enabled, and then use one of the links below to assumeRole into the account you want to access. **Note**: When you initially set up MFA, _you will need to log out and in again before you can assume a role_.

# API Access
There is a file in this repo "credentials" that has a sample of how to access AWS via the APIs whilst using assumeRole. Annoyingly, it seems that you must add your MFA serial number to each profile individually.






# Account Links

This page lists _all_ of the sub-accounts of the MDTP root AWS account. It also provides details of all IAM roles which are available for use in each of the accounts.

Please ensure that the list is kept up to date as accounts and roles are maintained.
